Pamir is a computational tool for detecting novel sequence insertions in single or multiple paired-end WGS(Whole Genome Sequencing) Illumina reads based on orphans and one-end anchors (OEA).

### How do I get Pamir?
Just clone our repository and issue the `make` command:
```
git clone --recursive git@bitbucket.org:compbio/pamir.git
cd pamir && make
```
> **Note**: You will need at least g++ 4.8.2 and Python 2.7 to compile the source code.

### How do I run MiStrVar?
You can use
